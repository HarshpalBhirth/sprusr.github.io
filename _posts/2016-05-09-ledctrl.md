For the last hack of the season, I wanted to have something cool. So for AnvilHack II I set up my LEDs to be controlled via a webpage. We had it on our table during the entire hack, and moved it to underneath the screen for presentations.

The patterns were pre-programmed on an Arduino which was connected to the strip itself. The Arduino received numbers corresponding to which pattern to use via serial. These values were sent from a Node.js server, which in turn received which number to send from the webpage, using socket.io, which was triggered by the buttons on the page.

People seemed to like playing with them. Although a member of my team got so fed up with them flashing that he wrote a Greasemonkey script to continuously press the off button.
