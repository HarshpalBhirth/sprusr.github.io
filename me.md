Some stuff about me

* Javascript is my favourite language ‚ô•
* I use a Mac and spend most of my time in web browsers, terminals and text editors
* I listen to a lot of music
* Since starting uni, I love hackathons
* I really like cycling but I don't have a bike at the moment :(

And here's a list of links

* [chipmusic.org](http://chipmusic.org/) - great community, love everyone there
