  - title: Muki.js
    description: >
      I got to play with one of [these cool mugs](http://pauligmuki.com/) at a
      hackathon. It has an e-ink display, powered by the heat of the liquid
      inside! Their existing developer libraries were for Android and iOS, so I
      reverse engineered the mug and implemented their Bluetooth API in
      javascript!

  - title: vpncmd.js
    description: >
      I got interested in setting up and maintaining my own VPN server, and what
      better way to manage such a thing than with javascript! And because it
      (pretty much) didn't already exist, I wrote a module for controlling a
      SoftEther VPN server.

  - title: Don't Laugh
    description: >
      A really stupid, and yet incredible hackathon project in the form of a game. A camera and elastic band shooting robot move back and forth - if you laugh or even smile, you get shot!
