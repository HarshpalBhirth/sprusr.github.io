<h2>About</h2>
<p>
  Hi! I'm Scott, a second year Computer Science student at Aston in Birmingham,
  UK. My favourite things are cycling, retro tech and beer. In my time as a
  student so far, I've been lucky enough to get to travel all over the place to
  hackathons and conferences, and be involved with some amazing groups of
  people!
</p>
<p>
  If you're interested, I maintain a <a href="/list">list of links</a> to
  interesting stuff. I also have <a href="bitcoin:19pz3P4QtxFyfv4BtTW9C1qcJaXzGg96vz?amount=0.005">a bitcoin address</a>.
</p>
<h2>Projects</h2>
<ul class="projects">
  {% for project in site.projects %}
  <li>
    <a href="{{ project.url }}"><img src="{{ project.image }}" alt=""></a>
    <h3><a href="{{ project.url }}">{{ project.title }}</a></h3>
    <p>{{ project.description | markdownify }}</p>
  </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
<h2>Speaking</h2>

    Hackcon EU - <i>Inside the mind of a fresher</i>

  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  I have talks drafted about various things, including overcommitment/burnout,
  collecting <em>things</em> and the beliefs of an esoteric magical cult. If any
  of these sound interesting, please get in touch.

<h2>Hackathons</h2>
<p>
  I'm often asked how many hackathons I've attended. The count is currently at
  {{ site.hackathons | size }}, and the full list is below.
